This is a simulation of a restaurant system where there is 4 types of Users; Customers, Managers, and Waiters,and Cooks.
 User starts by entering his valid username or password.
Customers can book a reservation by entering number of seats and if table is in smoking area or not, then enter the dishes he wants to order and finally presses conirm to reserve order and the reserved table number is shown with the total bill.
Managers can view the reserved tables with the Customer name, ordered dishes, total bill of each reservation, and finally his total income for the day.
Waiter will view the reserved table numbers with the Customer name.
Cooker will view the ordered dishes for the day with the table numbers ordering them.
We started working on this project by creating the class diagram together thinking about what we whant our program to do and what are the classes we need.
Manar Abdelkader:Users,User,Dishes,Dish,RestaurantManager,Main
Mariam Elkamhawy:Restaurant,Tables,table,Reservations,reservation,Client,Manager,Waiter,Cooks
We then worked online together using screen sharing and Gitlab push and pull confirming together on the classes and finishing the rest of the 
classes,GUI,JAR,and made changes needed in the other classes and UML class diagram.
We did our best to make this program as OOP as possible but it was a bit challenging as this was the second project for both of us working with java
we searched everyday and we did learn a lot and there is always more to add to this project but this is what we reached with our time limit of learning and creating the project.
thank you!
